Phases of Group Development and Social Work Helping Process 
 
a. Groups are changing, dynamic and have a life of their own. It natural for groups to undergo 
phases as part of group development. Social workers engaged in helping groups will find 
knowledge of group phases very important. Knowledge of phases of group development 
enables her to recognize and guide from the start to end of groups’ existence. The 
knowledge provides her with diagnostic clues per group phase, predict certain events that 
can occur, plan appropriate interventions, avoid confusion and insecurity and alert her to 
processes observed at each phase.  
b. Conceptions of group phases vary among authors, Hartford, Garland, Jones, Kolodny, Schutz, 
Thelen, and Henry but a beginning, middle and ending phases are common to all. The 
movement is not linear and not clearly demarcated. Not all social work groups pass through 
all the phases as in the case of drug addicts in a rehabilitation center. Because these groups 
are already in the center, they do not have to go through the pre group phase and move to 
group formation. Margaret Hartford’s formulation of the five phases is discussed here.

Stages/Phases Character of group 
system 
Character of member 
behavior 
Member and collective 
tasks 
Tasks for social workers Skills of the social worker 
Pre-affiliation 
• the Group qua group is 
non-existent and 
therefore is a source of 
stress rather than support 
to members. 
• The work of the group is 
unknown and the focus 
ambiguous 
• The group is without 
structure and norms. A 
climate of trust has yet to 
be developed 
• Rules of behavior are 
individually rather than 
collectively determined. 
There are individual 
rather than collective 
relationships 
• Members are unable to 
see a strong connection 
between their troubles 
and the troubles of others 
thereby increasing a 
sense of uniqueness and 
isolation 
• They have little 
connectedness and 
mistrust each other as 
well as the worker. 
Mistrust of the worker is 
based upon previous 
relationships with 
authorities. Indirect 
communication with an 
approach-avoidance 
pattern in relationships 
predominates 
• Strong societal taboos 
and norms militate 
against intimacy and 
sensitive areas of work. 
Members are uncertain 
about their ability to 
handle the demands they 
imagine will be made 
upon them 
• In this initial phase there 
is a need to develop a 
collective, specific idea 
of the work of the group 
based upon the 
connection between 
their need and agency 
service, whereby 
individual stakes can be 
located within the 
collective agreement 
• Members must establish 
an initial division of labor 
between the worker and 
themselves so potential 
benefits and obligations 
may be more clearly 
understood 
• The development of an 
initial structure for work 
and a culture in which 
authenticity and honest 
communication is the 
norm becomes 
important. 
• The primary task of the 
social worker, in the initial 
stage is to clarify purpose 
and to arrive at a contract 
with the members as to 
the terms of their 
relationship and the focus 
of work 
• As components of this 
primary task the worker is 
called upon to tune in and 
develop a preliminary 
understanding of what 
the members may be 
bringing to this 
experience. She/he is 
expected to help define 
the division of labor 
between the worker and 
the members in which 
respective roles are 
portrayed 
• She/he is further 
expected to contribute to 
the development of a 
working understanding 
among the members as to 
the terms of the contract 
highlighting the 
relationship between 
members' individual 
• To offer a clear uncomplicated 
statement about the mutual 
stake between agency and 
clients in coming together 
• To generalize client need in an 
effort to establish connections 
among group members 
• To partialize client need, 
making concerns understood 
in their specific meaning 
• To develop receptivity to 
veiled client communication 
by responding to non-vernal 
and oblique expression 
• To reach for feedback 
• To encourage specificity in 
discussion and call attention 
to cloudiness of expression 
• To translate covert messages 
 

stakes and the stake of 
the group as a whole 
Power and 
Control 
• The group changes 
dramatically during this 
stage, moving from a kind 
of formless, ambiguous 
entity to a unit with 
primary concerns about 
power and control 
• The group is at its most 
vulnerable and the 
potential for dissolution 
looms the greatest 
• Rules, norms, and status 
are as yet undefined and 
there are few guidelines 
for the difficult work 
which must occur if the 
group is to survive 
• The group becomes 
polarized over affective 
and task issues and is 
principally divided over 
the authority and 
competence of the 
worker. Polarization 
threatens its very 
existence. The 
atmosphere becomes 
charged with feelings and 
ideas expressed in strong 
terms 
 
• Members are slowly 
becoming drawn into the 
group. Ambivalence 
among members 
intensifies as the group 
becomes a possible 
source of satisfaction. As 
this potential increases, 
criticism of the worker 
also rises as members 
begin to slowly 
understand that if they 
risk involvement they risk 
potential disappointment 
• Members become 
increasingly impatient 
and critical of each other, 
differing on the operation 
of the group. Status 
differentials among 
members become 
important 
• Members become 
competitive with regard 
to the support of the 
worker, whose protection 
is needed and feared due 
to the inherent 
dependence 
• A sense of confidence in 
the worker feels 
imperative, yet difficult to 
achieve, at the beginning 
of this stage. Members 
• To further develop into a 
mutual aid system 
• To "resolve" its 
relationship with the 
worker sufficiently to 
allow it to move on to 
the work for which it is 
gathered 
• The worker must help the 
group develop an 
effective mutual aid 
system including: a 
multiplicity of helping 
relationships, recognition 
of obstacles and 
challenges to mutual aid, 
firmly establishing the 
common ground between 
the individual and the 
group, conveying faith in 
the group and a vision as 
to the possibility of 
change Developing a 
structure for work is an 
integral part of this 
mutual aid system 
• Engage the challenge to 
his her authority, 
challenge obstacles to 
engaging the power of 
the worker, help the 
group resolve his/her 
power and develop 
sufficient trust so that the 
true work of the group 
can proceed 
• Skills used during this stage 
highlight the intimate balance 
between the group's affective 
and instrumental tasks 
• Affective skills include: 
encouraging the expression of 
difficult and taboo feelings 
and issues, particularly 
negatives towards the worker 
and the collective enterprise; 
offering direct support of 
expression; uncoding coded 
messages; and reaching inside 
the silence to encourage 
exploration of difficult 
material 
• Instrumental skills include: 
pointing to obstacles to 
mutual aid and encouraging 
their discussion without 
becoming infatuated by the 
process; pointing to the 
common ground between the 
individual and the group; 
pointing out when work is 
occurring and when it is being 
avoided; helping members 
move from the general to the 
specific; partializing larger 
problems into smaller units; 
reinforcing the various ways in 
which members work, 
especially the ways in which 
they help each other 

feel anxious and angry by 
the worker's greater 
latitude of acceptable 
behavior. Privately they 
may understand such 
freedom is necessary for 
authentic expression 
• Members may begin to 
coalesce around criticism 
of the worker. The 
process of "resolving" the 
authority issue is the first 
major piece of work for 
which the members need 
each other. The worker's 
competence is challenged 
Intimacy 
• At this point the group 
qua group is seen as 
satisfying and there is a 
significant increase in 
intimacy in member-to-
member relationships 
• With the worker's 
authority placed in a 
viable perspective, 
members can now devote 
full attention to satisfying 
their individual needs and 
being of help to each 
other 
• Consensus becomes 
important and cohesion 
increases. An agreed 
upon structure for work 
and expression of 
personal needs begin to 
• During this point there is 
a sharp increase in 
personal involvement in 
the form of greater risking 
and self-revelation 
• Members begin listening 
to each other, become 
more supportive, give to 
each other with less 
ambivalence and view 
each other and the 
worker as trustworthy 
• A new exploration of the 
function of the group 
strengthens further 
investment in the group 
itself. Members are 
protective of the group, 
guard against intrusion, 
stress positives, and 
• The group's primary task 
is to use the growing 
positive perception of 
the worker and of each 
other, to move directly 
towards the work of the 
group 
• Having previously 
resolved whether it 
would continue, it now 
must develop into a 
need satisfying entity 
and actually begin to 
satisfy individual need. 
Its charge is now to build 
upon the resolution of 
the previous stage, of 
power and control, to 
develop increasing 
comfort with and 
• As the group begins to 
operate in its more 
intimate atmosphere the 
worker needs to help with 
two central tasks: aiding 
the members in 
establishing a 
comfortable balance 
between self-revelation 
and their need to 
maintain some sense of 
privacy and secondly, 
assisting with the work 
itself 
• Members need additional 
support for their growing 
intimacy and need the 
worker to challenge 
obstacles to the 
development of mutual 
• The worker's skills here are 
designed to help the group 
maximize its push towards 
work. All skills are utilized 
within a context of pointing 
the members towards each 
other and towards 
strengthening individuals to 
use the group 
• The worker is called upon to 
partialize large problems into 
smaller units, to make note of 
multiple themes without 
abandoning attention to 
specific themes, to point out 
connections between parts of 
experiences, to point to 
connections between the 
general and the specific, to 
call for elaboration of issues 

appear in an atmosphere 
in which the worker is 
viewed more positively 
• There is a sharp increase 
in goal orientation. With 
the more realistic 
perspective on the 
worker, members begin 
to understand that they 
must work for what they 
get 
• For the first time, the 
group is valued for itself 
and is to be protected and 
developed. A climate of 
trust emerges 
become interested in 
group events 
acceptance of more 
intimate relationships 
• The possibility of 
intimacy within the 
group demands that 
members invest strongly 
both in their own 
situations and those of 
others. Members are 
likely to make increased 
demands of each other 
aid, e.g., embarrassment 
over sharing sensitive 
material. Increasing the 
demand for work through 
a call for specificity in 
discussion will help the 
group more meaningfully 
explore the details of the 
problems before them 
while encouraging members 
direct communication with 
each other and to encourage 
members to attach affect to 
intellect. As obstacles and 
resistance to the work appear, 
the worker must call attention 
to and encourage exploration 
of what was making the work 
hard 
Differentiation 
• The group as a working 
unit is now at its most 
mature, productive, 
cohesive stage. It has 
reached its highest 
degree of achievement 
and is strong enough to 
tolerate difference 
• Group norms are well 
established and highly 
functional. The group 
maintains a high degree 
of flexibility though roles, 
status and structure for 
work are clearly defined 
and utilized 
• A satisfying balance 
between affective and 
instrumental foci propels 
group development. At 
• Mutual aid and its 
inherent interdependence 
among members are also 
at their highest level of 
development at this point 
• Relationships among 
members are strongest, 
as is the relationship 
between the worker and 
the members 
• All are viewed as 
individuals and 
differences among them 
are maximally accepted. 
As differentiation occurs 
there is an increase in 
functional roles. 
Differences tend to be 
resolved by consensus, 
rather than the exercise 
• The major task of the 
group is to build upon 
the development of 
intimacy of the previous 
phase and to allow 
differentiation and the 
uniqueness of members 
to be incorporated in the 
group life 
 
• Understanding that this is 
the end of the work 
phase, the practitioner's 
central task is to help 
members clarify needs 
and gains, define 
remaining issues for 
attention and with 
members, labor towards 
satisfying those needs 
before the end of the 
group. Reinforcing 
strengths, ways of 
working, and group 
process assists the 
members in their efforts 
to promote 
differentiation 
• Skills at this point are 
essentially similar to those 
used in the stage of intimacy, 
with the addition of the 
worker pointing to the 
connections between the 
specific and the general. This 
particular skill is highlighted 
just prior to separation so 
members can more readily 
apply gains to future 
situations 

this point, the group is 
best able to move beyond 
its own boundaries and 
interact with its 
environment 
of status, authority, and 
power 
• A strong viable balance 
between the needs of the 
individuals and the needs 
of the group exists. 
Members have the sense 
of having gone through a 
lot together and have 
come out strong 
Separation 
• The group as a whole is 
affected dramatically by 
its impending demise. All 
affective and instrumental 
processes must now be 
devoted to disbanding the 
entity which took such 
great effort to develop. 
An eventual state of 
"grouplessness" must be 
achieved. The length and 
power of this stage will be 
influenced by the kind of 
group and what the group 
has meant to members 
• If positive feelings have 
been strong, those 
feelings can counter the 
sense of loss. If positive 
feelings have been weak, 
an experience of loss (of 
real or desired outcomes) 
will remain. What has 
been accomplished and 
how the group can move 
to disband become 
• In the face of the 
strongest ties in the life of 
the group, members 
begin to move apart. An 
approach avoidance 
pattern reappears based 
upon the strength of 
relationships and the 
experience of loss 
• Feelings of loss may 
generate anxiety and 
regression over the 
breaking of bonds. There 
is an increase in coded 
behavior, with movement 
back and forth among a 
range of responses. 
Mutual aid continues 
ambivalently 
• In this final stage, the 
group must evaluate its 
work, define any 
remaining tasks, and 
realistically attend to 
whatever is still possible. 
The group must find a 
way to dissolve its ties, 
without dissolving what 
the group has meant and 
provided 
• If appropriate, the group 
must think through and 
make connections to 
new resources for 
satisfaction. Members 
must achieve some 
measure of resolve 
about what they have 
achieved and must 
balance attending to 
their individual needs 
and the desire of others 
to be given too in this 
ending process. Parting 
• The primary task of the 
social worker is to help 
the group evaluate work 
accomplished, define 
remaining tasks, and 
complete as much of the 
outstanding work as 
possible 
• The professional must 
help the group "let go" 
and move forward 
towards new pursuits 
without abandoning 
established gains. Helping 
members understand and 
use the stages of ending 
(denial, anger, mourning, 
and acceptance) assists 
participants with their 
final set of tasks 
• Skills focusing upon both 
affective and instrumental 
aspects of the groups' 
experience are strongly 
needed 
• The worker begins by being 
aware of the use of time to 
safeguard space for the 
ending process. Shelhe will 
need to reach for the range of 
feelings generated by ending; 
establish connections 
between the ending process 
and the work of the group; 
watch and reach for cues with 
regard to ending turning 
covert, coded communication 
into overt, clear expressions; 
credit the process and 
outcome of the group 
reinforcing future supports; 
summarize discussion; point 
to the connections between 
the specific and the general 
and identify specific next steps 

central issues during this 
period. Members avoid 
new work and try to 
retain gains. In the face of 
loss, an approach-
avoidance pattern returns 
well is particularly 
important

E.  Social Work Helping Process 
Phases of the SW Helping Process Social Workers Activities 
1. Pre-group Activities a. Conceptualizing the Group Service  
• Social worker of agency initiates idea of group service or external person presents a program 
proposal  
• Program has a clear purpose which guides agency, worker and group  
• Program proposal contains rationale, target client, need to be addressed, membership 
criteria, resource requirements, procedures for setting up the program, time frame.   
• Announcement to staff, proposal undergoes refinement through inputs   
• Purpose of group program statement should emanate from agency purpose or function. It 
guides identification of client group and criteria  
 
b. Announcing the group services and recruiting members 
• POSTERS on strategic places (offices, markets, stores) 
• Announcement should be brief but clear and should mention the purpose of the program, 
who may apply, where to make inquiries 
c. Preparing Logistics 
• Logistical support for a group program would include personnel, facilitiesm and materials 
d. Enlisting Community Support 
• Groups, agencies, organizations crucial to program success 
 
 
2. Individual-focused Assessment and 
Planning 
This activity involves gathering information as basis for analysis toward identification of the need or 
problems. Activities include conducting: 
• Pre-group (individual level) interviews or intake  
• Creating the individual client profile  
• Case assessment or problem definition  

• Action planning. Under Action Planning, the social worker with the client does the 
following: formulating goals and establishing specific helping plans 
 
3. Group-focused Assessment and 
Planning 
The social worker does “mental” assessment during the pre-group interviews. The worker processes the 
information who will belong to the group, concerns to be addressed and activities to be undertaken. Two 
tasks undertaken in this activity are Group Composition and Group Formation. 
 
a. Group Composition 
 
• Selection of Members:  
•Based on 
•A. Agency purpose 
•B.Client compatibility (age, interests, interaction style, maturity, personality) 
•C.Worker's assessment of client individual situation and 
•D. Worker's  professional judgment 
•Sometimes group composition is predetermined (in institutions or group of clients 
themselves request for group service 
• Deciding Group Size: 
•Depends on purpose of the group 
•Treatment group-5-7 members 
•Task group- up to 15 members 
•Use of odd number as tiebreaker in resolving issues 
•>4 members- few resources 
•<20 members- difficult to keep all members in mind 
 
b. Group Formation 
• Worker starts with “getting-to-know-you” activity 
• Worker reviews agency mission, purpose of group program, 
• worker’s role 
• Worker encourages questions from members 
• Discussion on other matters in the agenda 
• Group members should agree on: 

i. Common group concern: Members identify common problem in social functioning, 
factors related to role performance, resources and needs 
ii. Norms and rules: During sessions-e.g.no verbal or physical violence, listening to whoever 
is talking, no dominating of conversation; Outside of sessions- practice confidentiality; 
Attendance, punctuality, assigned tasks 
iii. Schedule and venue of sessions 
iv. Group goals- Goals provide direction for worker and members. Goals are formulated from 
three perspectives: Members’, worker’s, and group system. The determination of group 
goals is not an event, but a process that involves two phases –  
(a) Exploration – is when the worker and the group members discuss area of mutual 
concern, consider different means to pursue these concerns, sort out their 
differences, and incorporate individual interests into common group-oriented goals. 
(b) Bargaining - comes in during incompatibility of goals, disagreements between and 
among members. 
 
4. Group-focused Planning (Use of 
Program Media) 
Program media - are tools used by the group worker in working with groups to achieve goals. These are 
verbal or non-verbal activities which the group (and the worker) engages in to achieved its goals. 
• Examples: Group discussions, role play, group dynamics exercises, play activities, film showing, 
field trips, creative literature, etc. 
• Uses of Program Media:  
i) Change behavior and attitudes 
ii) Promote individual values like emotional and intellectual growth 
iii) Influence group climate *Promote group interaction  
iv) Enrich group content  
v) Promote desired group values  
vi) Facilitate beginning, middle and ending stages of group life 
• Factors to Consider in Planning Program Media: 
i. Group goals  
ii. Members' objectives for joining 
iii. Appropriate to time and space  
iv. Age of members  
v. Emotional and social characteristics of members  
vi. Cultural and ethnic background  

vii. Physical characteristics  
viii. Group mood  
ix. Availability of materials  
x. Worker's skills and capacities 
5. Plan Implementation 
• Aspects of Plan implementation. Plan implementation defined as “all activities, worker 
intervention, group action which the group system directs towards the achievement of individual 
and group goals. Three aspects of Implementation are interventive roles, resources and services 
and problems and constraints. 
 
• Interventive roles. These are multiple groupworker actions used with or on behalf of clients, 
while using different helping approaches or models. Germain and Gitterman informs social 
workers to be prudent in the effects of these roles on the client. Clients can be harmed by 
workers with good intentions but dysfunctional interventions. Client’s full involvement in the 
helping process is thus needed. 
 
• Resources and services. These are material and non-material resources tapped or created by 
the worker to meet needs. Social workers need to know what resources, their location, how 
to maximize utilization, access details, duration, and criteria for availment. The skills for 
networking, communication, negotiation, ‘legworking’ are necessary to tap these services 
 
• Problems and constraints. These are challenges faced by worker which affect work with 
clients. Social workers carry heavy workloads, fund shortage, inadequate facilities and 
equipment, lack of staff and lack of supervision. These problems continue to persist in the 
future. To deal with them, social workers make do through initiative, resourcefulness, 
creativity, enthusiasm and dedication 
 
• Stances of Worker. These are the attitudes the worker brings to the different sessions and 
phases of group development. The four stances are direct, facilitating, permissive and 
flexible. 
 
I. Direct Stance. The worker assumes the role of leader, initiator, director of group 
processes. Used at the convening stage. Worker assumes major roles for organizing 

and convening the group, guiding members, doing interventions. Needed when 
group needs strong force. Worker assumes role of chairman in task groups 
II. Facilitating Stance. The worker views himself as a member of the group but with 
special abilities and skills. Used when members have experience in group 
participation, social capability and some independent strength. Worker views himself 
as member of the group but with special expertise and different roles and functions. 
Worker considers members’ ages, state of health and level of group development. 
Worker uses skills to encourage members to assume responsibilities, promote 
exchange of ideas. 
III. Permissive Stance. The worker gives minimum guidance to the group members. 
reinforces leadership, clarifies problems, evaluates group content and processes. 
Used when group is highly socially competent, strongly motivated and are 
experienced in group participation. Assumes group has clear purpose and focus. 
Worker provides minimum guidance using expertise in human relations and group 
behavior. Uses nonverbal interventions and aware of internal struggles in the group. 
IV. Flexible Stance. The worker changes to other stances in a session or course of several 
sessions. Worker changes stance or “shifts gears” in the course of a session or over 
several sessions based on: • Assessment of progress of group toward objectives • 
Needs, capacities and behavior of members • Level of group functioning • Problem 
of content or affect in the group 
6. Evaluation Two types of evaluation used in SW practice: 
1. Regular, periodic or formative evaluation provides feedback to the worker at designated period 
while implementation is ongoing.  
• Frequency: as planned (monthly, quarterly or semiannually).  
• Refinement: The worker tracks the progress of the group towards the goal. Results can 
be identified as on track, delayed, advance of schedule or off-track. With the latter, the 
worker does analysis of causes and calibrates accordingly.  
• Accountability: To client system, agency and public 
2. Terminal or Summative Evaluation - Evaluation conducted at the end of implementation period 
with the results measured versus the goals and objectives. Assesses actual goal achievement. It 
measures program impact. 
 

Evaluation is done at the: 
1. Individual level – through a worker’s case summary, where the comprehensiveness depends on 
type of group service provided. Case summary contains the stated problem, goals and objectives, 
results of periodic and terminal evaluation. 
2. Group level -  Worker summary contains group concern, group goals and objectives, periodic and 
terminal evaluation. 
 
Tool for evaluation - Records as evaluation tools. The documents of the group processes form the basis 
for evaluation. Types of documents a worker should maintain and assiduously write are: 
• Pre-group/intake interview records 
• Individual case assessments 
• Statement of group concerns/problems/group goals and plans 
• Attendance records o Process or summary recordings of group sessions 
• Records of marginal interviews (with members outside group sessions) 
• Collateral interviews with “significant others” 
• Evaluation records 
• Transfer/closing summaries 
7. Termination Termination - The final step is done when the goals are achieved or very little movement towards the 
goal. 
 
a. The effect is less emotional on close groups where members join and leave the group together as 
in training group. The termination is done smoothly with each member receiving a certificate of 
participation. 
b. The effect on open groups or treatment-oriented groups is different where members leave the 
group when individual goals are achieved. For example, drug abuse patients leave the group 
when treatment goals are met. 
 
I. Pre-termination - Hartford divides termination in three sub phases: pretermination, termination 
and post-termination. At the pre termination stage, there is acknowledgement and preparation 
for ending of the group. This gives the members time for letting the reality “sink-in” though 
termination should have been discussed at the group formation stage. Worker guides members 
to: 
• Work out difficult feelings 

•  Review accomplishments and gains 
• Plan a closing activity 
• Consider ideas of post-exit plans 
• Sue Henry calls this period a time of “mourning” 
II. Termination - The last actual session of the group. It can be the implementation of the closing 
activity. Worker acts like guest. 
III. Post-termination - This is a period of follow up on a request basis, individual or group.  
• Members can organize themselves into a self-help group  
• Worker can connect the members to a group in the community  
• Members can act as volunteers or resource in the agency
