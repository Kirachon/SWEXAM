Group Work Approaches and Models 
1. Developmental Approach 
Concepts Clients/Goal Strategies/Activities Example 
• Proponent: Emmanuel 
Tropp 
• Roots:  
• Grace Coyle: collective self-
help as theme of group 
work  
• Wilson and Ryland: use of 
group autonomy and 
decision making 
• Helen Phillip: importance of 
here-and-now, growth 
comes from within member 
• Schwartz: group function 
and leader role, concept of 
mutual aid, contractual 
relations between group 
and worker 
• Views man as moving 
toward self  realization 
moving from adequate, 
inadequate to good 
functioning 
• Focuses on man with 
untapped potentials, 
therefore, a resource to be 
utilized and social role 
performance. 
• 3 major themes: 
a. Humanistic-‘viewing of 
one human being by 
• Clients: Sectors affected by 
social development 
concerns of subsistence 
level of living, widespread 
unemployment and 
underemployment, 
population growth, effects 
of urbanization, rural 
underdevelopment, needs 
of special groups 
• Goal: To tap unused 
potential of group members 
in interpersonal 
development 
1. Beginning stage 
Members:  
a.  Are oriented to the 
new situation  
b. Understand reasons 
for group 
membership and 
tasks to be done  
c. Experience doubts or 
enthusiasm Worker: 
(i) Clarifies purpose 
and structure of 
group (ii). Establishes 
contract (iii). 
Facilitates /supports 
task selection (iv. 
Facilitates climate 
conducive to unity/ 
cooperation 
2. Middle Stage 
a. More open 
expression  
b. Increasing 
understanding and 
acceptance of values 
of group experiences 
by member  
c. Roles and statuses 
evolve

Mothers’ Group, pp. 
135- 141, Lee-
Mendoza (2015) 

another’-worker 
respects the group 
purpose and member-
to-member helping 
phenomena as key to 
growth 
b. Phenomenological - 
current behavior-
oriented 
c. Developmental- moving

d. People enhance their 
social functioning thru 
group experiences 
e. People’s group 
experiences should have

g. Effectiveness of group 
goal achieving process is 
the main goal of 
members and leader 
• Four basis processes 
undergone by groups

of satisfaction from 
accomplishment  
d. Show concern / 
anxiety from ending 
group membership 
and separation from 
worker and agency  

 
h. Group becomes a

plans 
 
2. Remedial Model 
Concepts Clients/Goal Treatment Sequence Example 
• Proponents: Robert D. 
Vinter and colleagues in 
early 1960s  
• Group is seen as a 
means, context, 
external influence of 
treatment. 
• As means, the group 
interactions and 
influences are used to 
affect the participants 
• As context, direct 
worker-client 
interactions effect 
• Clients:  
a. Used for treatment and 
rehabilitation of 
individuals whose 
behavior was 
disapproved by society 
(e.g., physically and 
mentally handicapped, 
legal offenders, 
emotionally disturbed, 
isolated or alienated 
persons, and those 
lacking effective 
socialization) 
1.  Intake  
2. Diagnosis and Treatment 
Planning  
3. Group composition and 
formation  
4. Group development and 
treatment  
5. Evaluation and termination. 
Strategy of Intervention (SI) for a 
treatment group 
• SI refers to using the ff. resources 
for helping individuals 
The case of 
Bukang Liwayway 
Group, pp. 171-
178, Lee-
Mendoza (2015) 

changes during and 
outside group sessions 
• As external influence, 
the group may be 
helped to change 
outside realities 
adversely affecting its 
members 
 
 
 
b. For those needing 
acquisition of new 
knowledge and skills to 
replace ineffective ones 
which are sources of 
difficulty: persons with 
disabilities; medical 
conditions; parents from 
low income families 
• Goal: To re-orient 
knowledge and skills of 
clients for enhanced social 
functioning in society 
• Resources are: worker  member 
interactions, member-member 
interactions, group program, and 
group’s structure. 
• SI are modes of intervention or 
means of influence which are: 
direct, indirect and extra. 
a. Direct means of influence 
• Worker as central 
person- object of 
identification and 
drives. Has authority, 
control over 
resources and 
facilities, valued 
competence and 
personal 
characteristic, group 
knowledge of her 
control over group’s 
destiny deems her a 
focal point for group 
emotions. 
• Worker as symbol 
and spokesman 
Worker is an 
influencer of 
legitimate norms and 
values as a 
representative of the 
agency and 
profession. Worker 
can personify values, 
spokesperson, create 

these values, use 
sanctions, limits and 
controls and lays 
down expectations. 
• Worker as motivator 
and stimulator 
Worker defines 
individual goals and 
tasks. 
• Worker as executive-
controler of 
member’s roles. 
Worker modifies 
client role or 
position; assists 
member to perform 
role more effectively; 
tries to change 
member’s role 
behavior 
b. Indirect Means of Influence - 
Worker influences the group 
who influences the member  
• Group purpose 
through  
• Selection of group 
members  
• Nature of activities  
• Size of group  
• Group procedures  
• Group development 
c. Extra Group Means of 
Influence - Worker influences 
the group through outside 

activities conducted on 
behalf of clients 
• Four major areas: 
1. Social roles and 
relations of 
clients prior to 
client 
status  worker 
may need 
information to 
understand 
client, forces and 
other’s responses 
2. Significant 
others- change in 
attitudes will 
effect change in 
environment 
which affects 
client 
3. Social system- 
patterns or 
conditions that 
need change 
because they are 
non-supportive 
to client 
4. Social 
environment of 
the treatment 
group-demands, 
available/not 
available 
resources, 

responses of 
people around 
 
3. Crisis Intervention Approach  
Concepts Clients/Goal Treatment Sequence Example 
• Crisis - Crisis is an “upset 
in a steady state”; an 
emotional reaction to a 
life-threatening event; 
temporary disturbance 
of equilibrium featured 
by paralysis of problem-
solving capacities. 
• Involves crisis  oriented 
work 
• 2-6 weeks duration 
• Useful for any target 
population (emergency 
rooms of hospitals, 
telephone “hot lines”, 
women’s desks in police 
stations, crisis centers 
for children and women, 
quick response teams, 
disaster programs 
• Should be available 
within 24-72 hours after 
referral or application 
for assistance 
• Client participation 
needs commitment and 
is voluntary 
 
• Clients:  
a. Individuals in crisis (e.g., 
survivors of rape and 
domestic violence) 
b. Persons related to 
individuals in crisis 
(professionals, and 
volunteers helping 
people in crisis) 
c. Those in collective crisis 
(disaster survivors) 
 
• Goals (Lydia Rapoport): 
a.  Relief of symptoms  
b. Restoration to pre-crisis 
level of functioning  
c. Understand relevant 
events contributing to 
crisis  
d. Identification of 
remedial measures that 
can be taken by client or 
from available resources 
e. Recognition of 
connection of past life 
events and current 
stress  
Four step approach in Group Crisis 
Intervention: 
1. Search for Precipitating event 
and its meaning to client  
2. Search for coping means used by 
client  
3. Search for alternative means of 
coping that might better fit the 
current situation  
4. Review and support of client 
effort using new ways 
Advantages of Group Crisis Intervention: 
1. Allows emotional release before 
others in the same situation  
2. Ease pain and offers hope  
3. Mobilize individual strengths and 
resources  
4. Mutual assistance for alternative 
coping  
5. Helps identify community 
resources 
The Case of the 
Mapayapa Group 
pp. 212-219. Lee-
Mendoza (2015) 

 f. Initiation of new models 
of thinking, perceiving 
and feeling and 
development of new 
adaptive responses. 
 
4. Interactionist Approach 
Concepts Clients/Goal Treatment Sequence Example 
• Proponent: William 
Schwartz 
• Mediating function of 
social work focuses on 
transactions between 
client and various 
systems around him 
(family, school, peers, 
neighborhood, job and 
others) 
o Relationship is 
symbiotic 
o Useful for any 
group 
• Mutual aid group with 
four features:  
a. Collective  
b. Need each other for 
a specific purpose 
c. Work on common 
tasks  
d. Work is embedded 
in a relevant agency 
function 
 
• Clients:  
a. Any group with the ff. 
features: 
o Group is seen as 
a collective 
where people 
interact with 
each other 
o People need 
each other for 
specific ends 
o People join a 
group for 
common tasks 
o The common 
task is within 
the sphere of 
agency function 
 
• Goal: To assist the group 
negotiate the system to 
meet their needs and help 
the system reach out to 
incorporate the client group 
and deliver its service 
1. “Tuning In” Requires worker to 
understand members’ feelings, 
self-doubts, about each other 
about the worker. 
2. The Beginnings: 
o Contracting process 
occurs: consensus of 
members’ needs and 
agency services. 
o Worker moves toward 
partialization of tasks and 
assists group in 
establishing ground rules 
and processes for 
problem-solving. 
3. Tasks  
o Locating common ground 
between needs and 
systems to negotiate 
with 
o Detecting obstacles 
between members and 
systems  
o Worker’s contributing 
facts, ideas, values  
The Case of the 
H-Mole Women’s 
Group pp. 188-
198. Lee-
Mendoza (2015) 

 o Worker’s sharing vision 
of the work, feelings on 
the process and faith in 
clients’ strengths  
o Worker’s defining limits 
and requirements of 
situation of work 
4. Ending and separation 
o Members take ending 
seriously, learning 
lessons 
o Ending with substance 
and feelings 
 
5. Family Intervention Approach 
Concepts Clients/Goal Treatment Sequence Example 
• Primary learning takes place 
first in a family  
• Family plays an important 
role in an individual’s 
development 
• The “social “aspect of a 
person refers to social 
relationships developed 
through socialization, the 
family’s main task. 
• 1950s- when the model 
started 
• Two types: Family therapy 
and Family-focused work 
a. Family Therapy 
• Use of systems 
approach, 
• Clients: Families which are 
coping poorly with 
communication, 
problem  solving, 
behavioral issues. 
• Goal: To modify or change 
elements in the family 
system which interferes 
with management of life 
tasks of family and its 
members 
1. Assessment Worker uses tools 
of ecomap and genogram 
2. Treatment Planning Worker can 
use Family life cycle matrix - 
Life Cycle Matrix determines at 
what stage and tasks are the 
family members in. Matrix 
helps worker to understand the 
physical, psychological, social 
and spiritual needs associated 
with each life cycle stage.  
3. Evaluation 
4. Termination 
The Case of 
Drunken Papa pp. 
237-257, Dehn 
and Cordero 
(2009) 

psychoanalytic 
theories 
• Can use 
different 
models: 
Communication, 
Bowenian, 
Strategic model 
by Haley and 
Madanes or 
Milan systemic 
school, 
Structural 
model by 
Salvador 
Minuchin; 
Solution-
focused Model 
by Erickson, De 
Shazer. Butler 
and Powers and 
Simon. 
• Can use in 
combination 
with other 
models 
depending on 
the case. 
b. Family-focused work 
• Family-focused 
work with 
individuals or 
family  focused 
treatment or 

(family 
casework) 
works with an 
individual 
member with 
members 
involved in the 
helping process, 
in pairs (couple) 
or as a group 
(whole family 
with significant 
others). This is 
seen in the 
cases of 
Maricel, Oscar 
and Nilo in Lee-
Mendoza 
(2008). 
 
 
6. Task-Centered Model with Groups 
• Proponents: Laura 
Epstein and William 
Reid 
• “Task” what a client is to 
do  
• Characteristics: 
a. Brief and time-
limited 
b. Interventions focus 
on specific problems 
agreed by worker 
• Clients: Persons in these 
problem areas 
a. Family and 
interpersonal relations 
b. Social role performance 
c. Effecting social 
transitions 
d. Securing resources 
e. Emotional distress 
reactive to situation 
factors 
a. Preliminary Interview -During 
individual interviews, problems 
are defined, clarified and agreed 
on. Worker assesses client if he 
can be helped through group 
processes. Seeks client’s consent 
for group membership.  
b. Group Composition Worker 
decides membership and size  
c. Group Formation Members share 
problems they seek to reduce by 
The case of Oscar, 
pp. 304-311. 
Mendoza, 2008) 

and client to work 
on 
c.  Work is organized 
around tasks agreed 
on 
• Features: 
a. Assessment-
exploring the 
problem, 
environment 
conditions, problem 
context, client traits, 
talents, abilities and 
problem behaviors 
b. Case Planning-plan 
of action to include 
formal information, 
actions, resources 
and agency policies 
c. Implementation- 
Contract is made- 
identifying tasks of 
client and worker, 
with firm but 
flexible goals, 
problems and tasks. 
Worker provides 
resources and 
instructs client in 
skills and favorable 
attitudes, monitors, 
evaluates progress 
and arranges 
• Goal: Alleviate specific 
target problems perceived 
by clients (individuals and 
groups 
formulating and accomplishing 
agreed-on tasks  
d. Group processes for task 
accomplishment Worker works 
with group once tasks have been 
agreed upon. 

termination as 
needed. 
• Tasks- state what a 
client is to do. Tasks are 
specific, can change in 
form and contents. 
Target problems can 
change sometimes. 
Worker uses group 
process in helping 
members formulate and 
attain tasks.
